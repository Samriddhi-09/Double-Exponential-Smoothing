# Double-Exponential-Smoothing
The R program shows the forecasting of carbon dioxide emissions and energy consumption for the next 15 years using Double Exponential smoothing method. The data contains carbon dioxide emissions values and energy consumption values of South Asian countries from the year 1990. As it's a yearly data so we choose double exponential smoothing as the data does not contain seasonal index. The libraries used are readxl, tseries,tidyverse,fpp2 and forecast.
